## Legend

**How often do you hang out in chat roulette?**

## Description

The web application ‚ÄúChat Roulette ‚ÄúLangSkillUp‚Äù‚Äù implements the mechanics of Chat Roulette, providing users with the opportunity to communicate in English language through video communication (the main type of communication) and text chat (an auxiliary type of communication). The built-in game mechanics will allow you to develop communication skills in English language.

Also this project implements Domain Driven Design 
principles

We use WebRTC for send video traffic through 
the Internet. 
Everything works fine, but due to the fact
that we use free stun servers, video traffic is
not always delivered to recipients. If you liked 
the concept of this application, then click on the 
star in the repository and after 15 likes I will 
launch the application with paid servers for video
traffic.
